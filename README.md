To Do: Fill this up with more details later

Currently used for a driving game I am working on:

"What are your current aims for the driving game?"


"
The high level gameplay pitch is something like: "Trackmania x Death Stranding' where you have an open world to explore in a vehicle and can build tracks anywhere in that world.

For this project part of it is that the OpenGL wrapper is developed by an online friend in a community I am active in so this was a project idea in order to test its use in a 'real game project'.  So a game without an engine. Making a game can also help me maybe make my own engine outside of a school project

Another part is I wanted to develop two different skills: Making open world asset streaming and creating dynamic level editors from a user perspective. 
I chose the context of an open world driving game because I like that genre of gaming and it has relatively simple game design. "
